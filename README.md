# Elective Support BPHC
This is an Android Based ChatBot which guides students of BPHC to choose their electives based on their choices.

## Brief Description
This project is a part of **Artificial Intelligence** Assignment. In this project, we have built an **Android App** which serves a chatbot similar to AliceBot. We have used **AIML** to make the core
of the chatbot. **Pattern matching** and **Intent recognition** were basically used to give replies to the user. The bot also stores persistent copies of the intercations in a flat file.
The bot could also **interact with web services** to know the trending jobs in the domain.
